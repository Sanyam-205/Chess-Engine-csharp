    White to move. +ve value= = better for white. -ve value = better for black. This is standard mimimax. Negamax is slightly different which will be explained later.
    
    In this example, for branch A, alpha is 3 which is the best score for white and beta is -1, the best score for black.
    For branch B, alpha is 1, the best score for white and beta is -5, the best score for black. We always assume that the opponent makes the best move for them leading to highest beta value.
    Beta can also be explained as the absolute best score we can have for that particular branch. For example, if -1 and -5 both continued downwards, these two scores would be the absolute best we would be looking to get if we went down those paths.
    Since at depth 0, the function must return the move order leading to best possible evaluation for you meaning the branch with best Alpha value.
