    In this example, for branch A, alpha is 3 which is the best score for white and beta is -1, the best score for black.
    For branch B, alpha is 1, the best score for white and beta is -5, the best score for black. We always assume that the opponent makes the best move for them leading to highest beta value.
    Beta is the maximum score the opponent will allow us to get
    Beta can also be explained as the absolute best score we can have for that particular branch. For example, if -1 and -5 both continued downwards, these two scores would be the absolute best we would be looking to get if we went down those paths.
    Since at depth 0, the function must return the move order leading to best possible evaluation for you meaning the branch with best Alpha value.

    /*
        Killer moves are used to score quiet moves that caused a beta cutoff in the game so that our move ordering logic can order these quiet moves.
        Killer moves store the 2 best moves that caused beta cutoff at each ply and is updated at each ply.
        In killer moves, a move that caused a beta cutoff at a specific ply is scored. Imagine MaxPly is 8, meaning the engine will search at 8 depth. Killer move store the encoded move struct, for example at depth 1, e2e4 caused a beta cutoff so killerMoves[1, 1] will store encoded e2e4 ushort value and ScoreMove will give it a score (90 for first move, 80 for second). 
        When e2e4 is scored, the move ordering logic orders it higher than other quiet moves which have a score of 0.
        Now, at depth 2, the move d2d4 caused beta cutoff. So now, killerMoves[2,1] will store d2d4 as e2e4 was shifted one place down to [2,2]. Same move ordering and scoring logic applies.
        If the same move causes beta cutoff, then it is discarded.
        Now, suppose at depth 7, somehow Nc6 causes beta cutoff, so killerMoves[7,1] will store Nb1c6, killerMoves[7,2] will store d2d4 and e2e4 is replaced.    
    
    */
    int[,] historyMoves = new int[12,64]; //12 = number of piecesm 64 = board squares.
    /*
        History heuristics are also used to apply a score to quiet moves that caused beta cutoff so our move ordering logic can order these moves higher than standard quiet moves (with score of 0). 
        But unlike killer moves that store 2 best moves that caused beta cutoff at specific ply, history heuristics, store moves that caused beta cutoff throughout the game. 
        The idea is that if a quiet move caused a beta cutoff at one part of the game, then that move is likely good enough to be assigned a higher search priority.
        If a move e2e4, causes beta cutoff multiple times, then that move's score is higher and it will be searched first.
        Imagine the move Nb1c3 causes beta cutoff once, historyMoves, store [1,18] -> white knight = 1, c3 = 18 and assigns it a score x. That same move, causes beta cutoff once again in a different search tree, so now the previous score historyMoves[1,18] will be added to its new value, so historyMoves[1,18] will store x+y
        Because we are tracking the entire game, moves that cause beta cutoff frequently should be assigned higher scores than moves that cause beta cutoff rarely.

        The general formula for historyMoves is historyMoves[piece, square] += depth * depth. But we can't use this directly because 1. it will cause integer overflow pretty quickly. 2. We still need mvv-lva captures and quiet moves to be scored higher, so we apply bounds to this.

        There is also an idea where moves that don't cause beta cutoff are given a penalty. We will see if we implement this or not....

    /* A principal variation table is used to store the sequence of moves that will result in the best move for that depth. At depth 6, the alpha value (score) will show the evaluation after the board has reached that particular stage. The root node is the final move at that particular depth. We need to store the sequence of moves. Here's how we do it.
    A 2d array in which, one element referes to the depth value as depth decreases in each recursive call of the loop and another sotring the best move found.
    Lets say, the best sequence of moves for a position is this -> e2e4, e7e5, d2d4, d7d5, g1f3, b8c6. The pvTable will look like this -
    depth    move sequence
      6      .e2e4
      5      .e2e4 .e7e5
      4      .e2e4 .e7e5 .d2d4 
      3      .e2e4 .e7e5 .d2d4 .d7d5 
      2      .e2e4 .e7e5 .d2d4 .d7d5 .g1f3
      1      .e2e4 .e7e5 .d2d4 .d7d5 .g1f3 .b8c6
    *If we were only storing the root node, it will just give is b8c6*

    To copy the content of the previous depth onto the next depth, we need another pvLength table.

                /*Beta cutoff in alpha beta pruning and TT are somewhat different. 
                In alpha beta pruning, the beta cutoff is telling us that if a line is too good for us and the opponent already has another line that whose score is less than the score of this line then the opponent will never let us enter that path.
                That path is 'too good' because up in the tree, the opponent has another line that leads to a better evaluation for them
                A better, guaranteed evaluation for the opponent is the beta score..
                
                To understand TT, TT does not care if the opponent will ever let us enter than line. That is managed by alpha beta pruning. TT only cares to return the evaluation that we were going to get if that line were to happen.
                TT tells us that if that line were to happen, then you could get atleast this much score. So this becomes our lowerbound. 

                Imagine alpha = 20, beta = 50, score = 90.
                alpha being 20 means that out current best score is alpha. Beta being 50 means that the opponent already has a line that forces our score to be 50. Score being 90 means that if we were to go down that line than we could get an evaluation of 90.
                In alpha beta pruning, this is too good so opponent will never allow it.
                In TT however, if we were to ever go down that line then 90 is the score we are guaranteed to have so that 90 becomes our lowerbound flag which is hashBeta.
